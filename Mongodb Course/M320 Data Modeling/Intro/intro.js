Methodology:
The methodology we use composed of three phases.
-> The first phase is to describe the workload. In other words, it means gathering everything
there is to know about how you would be using your data.

-> The second phase is to identify the relationship between the different entities you need to 
handle and choose how to model those relationship.

-> The third phase is to apply design patterns or transformation to the current model.
